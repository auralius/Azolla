                              ------------

Azolla is a development framework for mobile robot simulation using C++ 
language. Azolla is designed by emphasizing on simulation for 
probabilistic robotics. Its features are including: odometry, occupancy 
algorithm, mapping, and also localization.  The main goal for this 
simulator software development is to develop a simple 2D mobile robot 
simulator for testing even a sophisticated algorithm. The specific goals 
are to build a multi platform and lightweight mobile robot simulator 
which is easy to use.

HOW TO INSTALL (Linux):
- First install FLTK libraries and Boost libraries.
- Make sure you have Codeblocks installed.
- Open  folder build/codeblocks and open file Azolla.cbp using Codeblocks.

I have provided VS project file for Windows users but I haven't updated it 
sine last modification. I also plan to create a makefile.

Azolla is a development framework for mobile robot simulation using C++ language. Azzola is designed by emphasizing on simulation for probabilistic robotics. Its features are including: odometry, occupancy algorithm, mapping, and also localization.  The main goal for this simulator software development is to develop a simple 2D mobile robot simulator for testing even a sophisticated algorithm. The specific goals are to build a multi platform and lightweight mobile robot simulator which is easy to use.
